# Bengali-Sentence-Validation
Checking the correctness of Bengali Sentences using learning models


For this project, a new dataset called the BSV dataset has been developed to train and test the different learning models. To ensure the proposed model is generic, robust and language-agnostic, the model has been evaluated using a publicly available English dataset. Those datasets are available in the Dataset folder.
